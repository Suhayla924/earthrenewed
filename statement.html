      The website puts you into the perspective of an alien that has crash landed
       on to the planet Earth to find out the human race has disappeared and this
       mysterious moss has covered the planet. </p>
     <p> For aesthetic of landscape created suggestions and abstractions of industrial structures being covered in moss to suggest the idea of nature reclaiming itself from industrialization of humans. </p>
       <p>
      My concept behind this project was to create a world where nature has “reclaimed”
       the land where cities once stood. During the quarantine, there were
       instances where the streets were so barren that animals were roaming
       the empty streets of once busy cities. I thought it would be
       interesting to create a familiar setting that has been
       transformed by a natural force, which brings in the concept of
        “world-building”.
        I have created a world that does not exist in the present but
        a world that contains scenery and landscape that
         is familiar yet new to the viewer.
         It would be interesting to push the idea further and add more abstracted
         concepts such as now that humanity has disappeared from the planet
         the essence of the earth can truly manifest of something of that nature.
